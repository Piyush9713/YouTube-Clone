# YouTube Clone - MERN Stack & Tailwind CSS

This is a comprehensive YouTube clone built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled using Tailwind CSS. The project aims to replicate YouTube's core functionalities, including video uploads, playback, user authentication, comments, likes, and more, offering a seamless user experience across devices.

## Features
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user registration and login with hashed passwords and JWT-based authentication. User profiles include an avatar, watch history, and a personalized feed.
- **Video Upload & Streaming**: Users can upload videos, with support for various file formats and sizes. The backend efficiently handles video storage, processing, and streaming, ensuring smooth playback on different devices.
- **Responsive & Intuitive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the UI adapts to various screen sizes, offering a responsive and modern look. Features include a dynamic homepage, video player, search bar, and a sidebar for easy navigation.
- **Like, Dislike & Comment System**: Users can interact with content by liking, disliking, and commenting on videos. Comments support nested replies, creating a more engaging community experience.
- **Subscription & Notification System**: Allows users to subscribe to channels and receive notifications about new content, enhancing user engagement.
- **Search & Filter**: An efficient search and filter system that allows users to find videos by keywords, categories, or upload date.
- **State Management**: Uses Context API and Redux Toolkit to manage global states, like user authentication, video metadata, and user interactions, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience.
- **Backend & REST API**: Built with Node.js and Express, the RESTful API handles video uploads, streaming, user data, authentication, and interactions. It includes input validation, error handling, and optimized queries for fast data retrieval.
- **Database**: MongoDB serves as the database, storing user profiles, video details, comments, likes, subscriptions, and notifications.
- **Optimized Performance**: Implementing lazy loading for video content, caching strategies, and optimized API endpoints for an enhanced and scalable performance.
- **Error Handling & Security**: Comprehensive error handling, input validation, and security practices, such as data sanitization, to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express for building a robust API.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **State Management**: Context API and Redux Toolkit for efficient state handling.
- **Additional Tools**: Multer for file uploads, JWT for authentication, and Cloud services (e.g., AWS S3) for video storage.

## Getting Started

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret).
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Backend
- The backend provides endpoints for video management, user authentication, comments, and interactions.
- Proper API documentation is available to guide integration and testing.

### Frontend
- The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Includes setup for routing, state management, and component structure to ensure code modularity and scalability.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing live streaming.
- Adding video monetization and ads.
- Integrating a recommendation system using machine learning.

This project serves as an educational tool for building full-stack applications using the MERN stack, showcasing how to handle file uploads, manage state, design a RESTful API, and style a modern, responsive UI.
